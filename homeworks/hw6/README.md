# MyBooksApp

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a simple application we build during lectures in fall 2020 OOSE class together to practice with various concepts
and technologies. This is a web app conforming to Client-Server Architecture where user(s) can store their favorite books
and authors. The app will store data in a database and its backend functionalities are implemented as RESTful API
end-points.

Work Done:
- Deployed the MyBooksApp on Heroku
- Set up an automated deployment workflow similar to HerokuDemo

Assumptions Made:
- As per the last homework and the limitations of validate.js, there are a number of assumptions made about the
well-formedness of inputs (for example, the year and number of books are assumed to be well-formed, positive numbers,
publisher and author are assumed to be nonempty strings.)
- Otherwise, since most of the work was on deploying on Heroku and setting up the auto deployment, there aren't any
assumptions to be made.
