# MyBooksApp

The main functionality of this package is the persistent storage of authors and books through the use of SQL databases in conjunction with client-server architecture supported by RESTful API endpoints. The state of, and functionality for, storage of the aforementioned authors and books is visually represented and assisted by a graphical HTML frontend, which uses cookies to maintain minor local storage of user information and preferences.

In addition to the previous assumptions made, we assume that input is nonmalformed, with malformed input returning a 500 (internal server error) status code handled by SparkJava (as an example, inputting a non-numerical string into the year field for addbook returns a 500 status code.) Additionally, the main changes in code from the prior homework/iteration of this package are to be found in java/Server.java (addition of routes, username and color handling), java/persistence/Sql2oAuthorDao.java (addition of a helper function), and resources/public/templates/books.vm and resources/public/templates/addbooks.vm (created to support functionality of book management route.)
