# MyBooksApp

The main functionality of this package is the persistent storage of authors and books through the use of SQL databases in conjunction with client-server architecture supported by RESTful API endpoints. In addition to the main functionality as mentioned before, this package also includes various tests for the implementations devised.

The main assumptions made in the implementation of this package are that the SQL server assigns IDs to new entries in an empty table starting from id = 1, and incrementing by one, and that the server automatically sends a 500 html status code if there is an exception or error on the server side when executing a route (other status codes are manually set in Server.java). Additionally, the main changes in code from the prior homework/iteration of this package are to be found in src/main/java/Server.java and src/test/java/RESTAPITest.java.
