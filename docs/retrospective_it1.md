We designed and added POJO classes for Calendar, Event, User, and implemented Dao classes to add them to our sqlite databases. The corresponding routes
were also added to the server. For iteration 1, the core avaliability information is being stored as a blob column in the database; this will be changed
in future iterations.

We also designed two front end pages, one for creating calendar templates, and one for viewing avaliability of multiple calendars. The page to create
templates has two export functions, one to download locally, and one to store on the server. The page to view avaliability can currently only view
local calendars stored as files; in the future this page will also be able to read from the server to display avaliability.

One thing that was a challenge was managing our time to implement our goals in a timely manner. We will work on making a better schedule for work, and
also a better workflow working with git.

We can also do better assigning tasks and being clear who will be responsible for working on what new feature or fix.

We can also do a better job making the front end UI more reflective of the mockups we made.
