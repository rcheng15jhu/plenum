# Software Requirements Specificatins

## Problem Statement 

> Write a few sentences that describes the problem you are trying to solve. In other words, justify why this software project is needed.

There currently exist multiple scheduling websites like When2Meet that, though useful
for seeing peopleâ€™s availability and arranging meeting times based on max availability,
do not save previously entered availability. Users have to re-enter the same
availability every time they fill out a new When2Meet, which proves to be inconvenient
and inefficient.


## Potential Clients
> Who are affected by this problem (and would benefit from the proposed solution)? I.e. the potential users of the software you are going to build.

Any person or group of people who needs to keep track of their schedules and share it
with others in order to coordinate meeting times, especially those that want to save
their schedules and settings so that they save time not needing to input the same
settings over and over again.


## Proposed Solution
> Write a few sentences that describes how a software solution will solve the problem described above.

Create a web application that allows users to not only create a calendar and have
other users go to the link to fill out their availability on the calendar, but have
extra features that allow users to import an existing calendar elsewhere or save
their previous inputs. This would make the process of arranging meetings much more
efficient and less tedious.


## Functional Requirements
> List the (functional) requirements that software needs to have in order to solve the problem stated above. It is useful to write the requirements in form of **User Stories** and group them into those that are essential (must have), and those which are non-essential (but nice to have).

### Must have
* As someone who needs to share my availability with other people, I need this
application to include a way to have me enter, save, and submit my availability,
so that I can coordinate with others more efficiently.

* As someone who needs to be able to coordinate scheduling between multiple people,
I need this application to have a way to view aggregate availabilities, so that I
can coordinate events more efficiently.

* As someone who frequently has to schedule multiple distinct events with other people,
I need to be able to log in and log out of this application to securly store information
related to my availability.

* As someone who frequently has to schedule multiple distinct events with other people,
I need this application to include a way to include a default availability schedule
so that I can submit my availability more conveniently.

* As someone who frequently has to schedule multiple distinct events with other people,
I need this application to store many different calendars for me, so that I can submit
my availability differently for events that I have different amount of
commitments to. For example, for my job I may want to list more availability, but for a
school club, I may want to list less availability, and I would like both calendars to
be stored for quick use.

* As someone who frequently uses my calendar to schedule events throughout my life,
I need to be able to import my schedule from my calendar application, so that I can
set my availabilities in an efficient and convenient way.


### Nice to have
* As a college student who has to center my life around my classes, I would like to be
able to set my availability directly by importing the class schedule I have this
semester (through sis integration) so as to make my scheduling quick and easy to
carry out.

* As a student who works with people in other time zones, I would like to easily be
able to set and view my availability in any time zone of my choosing, so as to be able
to more easily communicate with people in different time zones.

* As a student who works with people in other time zones, I would like to easily view
my availability by reshaping the calendar so that each distinct day in my local time
zone is displayed on a different column.

* As a user that wants to avoid wasting time on deciding a meeting time once
the group's availability is known, I would like to be able to suggest meeting
times within the application itself, which are placed on a ranked list. Individuals
in the event can upvote/downvote suggested events to come to a consensus about which
meeting time is most optimal. 

* As a user that wants to avoid wasting time on deciding a meeting time once
the group's availability is known, I would like the application to suggest meeting times
autonomously for the group, based on the avaliability, so as to more easily finalize
a meeting time once avaliabilities are known.

* As someone who frequently has to schedule multiple distinct events with other people
on different days of the week, I would like to store calendars specifically for certain
days of the week, so as to allow me to plan my availability in different chunks for different
times of the week.


## Software Architecture
> Will this be a Web/desktop/mobile (all, or some other kind of) application? Would it conform to the Client-Server software architecture? 

* This would be a client-server architecture. We may potentially use React for the
frontend and a simple framework like Javalin or Sparkjava for the backend.


## User Stories
> List major user stories here

Please refer to the functional requirements above, which are written in user story
form. This matches the format we had for Homework 1, where functional requirements
and user stories were combined. https://piazza.com/class/kd13q8ukge2e1?cid=71_f1
