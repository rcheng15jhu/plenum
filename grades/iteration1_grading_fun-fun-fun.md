# Iteration 1
_(Grading based on commit `e386841ac9ad342c291753c51820e7bd19d73209`)_

## Requirement Specification (19/20)

- Reasonable problem statement. It's smart to start from comparing with a real application, then try differentiating from it.
- Delicate wireframes! I really like your UI design, which clearly shows all functions and is also user-friendly.  
- It will be even better if more information is included in software architecture. For example, how would you store the data?
And how you plan to send data between front-end and back-end?
- For functional requirements/user stories, each item is a little complicated. It may be helpful for future work if you can divide them into more focused ones.

## Class Diagram (10/10)

- The class diagram perfectly matches your code, great job!
- As your features increase, your class modeling may need to be modified later. For example, you may need to simplify the dependency relationships for future use.  
So please remember to update the class diagram if your design indeed change.

## Git Activities (14/15)

- Great to see every one contributed to the project. But next time try to balance work a little more. 
- Did well in using branches and issues.
- If you have time, try collaborating by submitting, commenting and approving pull requests. It's not a requirement, but it definitely deserves a try.

## Github Project (10/10)

- All issues tagged with iteration1 have been done. Keep going!
- For each iteration, you can create a project plan for it, which is easier to track. : )

## Implementation (20/20)

- You have a good start! Multiple features have been implemented, such as showing calendar by uploading json file, uploading data to the database,
and downloading calendar files.
- Front-end and back-end can run successfully. 
- May need more thoughts about how to build a client-driven application. For example, for users, 
it might be convenient if they can switch among different pages by clicking on buttons. 
- It's great to see you have prepared all endpoints.

## README (3/5)

- Includes a basic introduction about the app.
- Should be more comprehensive by adding more parts. For instance, have a guide to how to run it.
- Please take advantage of bullet points to make your README more organized and readable.


## Comments

#### Things Done Well

- Great and valuable idea.
- Brilliant UI design. No one would use When2Meet anymore after your app is launched. :D
- It's great to see you discuss a lot about how to develop your app at every group meeting. 

#### Things That Can Be Improved

- Balance GitHub commits and start working earlier. 
- Might need to break down the tasks listed in SRS. Currently, each of your function requirement actually contains more than one feature.
- Provide a more detailed README document, so that users can know if they need to install any packages, and how to import the project etc.
Here's a [good sample](https://github.com/yaozixuan/QuizHero). You can elaborate yours in future iterations.
